<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initially requested to update the profile pictures for the members on the team page. The new images were provided via a Google Drive link. Only members who already had a picture should have it replaced.

Subsequently, the user requested a major design overhaul for the entire website with the following requirements:
- Replace the existing logo and favicon with new files from a Google Drive link.
- Update the navbar text from JKU Linz to ÖH JKU Linz and make the logo larger.
- Instead of a persistent background image, place new images (from another Google Drive folder) contextually within the sections of the homepage (Hero, Über uns, Gallery).
- The image placement, choice, and centering must be aesthetically pleasing and responsive for both desktop and mobile views.
- Several iterative adjustments were requested for image size, cropping, and content.
- A horizontal scroll issue on mobile needed to be fixed.
- The static image in the gallery section at the bottom of the homepage should be replaced with an auto-playing Diashow (slider) of the top 5 images.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Routing**: 
- **Image Slider**:  (being implemented)
- **Styling**: Heavy use of Tailwind CSS for responsive design, including aspect ratios, object-fit, and responsive variants (e.g., , ).

**key DB schema**
  - N/A

**changes in tech stack**
  - Added  and its peer dependencies to the frontend .

**All files of reference**
- **Modified:**
  - : Major rewrite to implement the new design with image collages and sections.
  - : Updated image paths for team members and added conditional logic for the placeholder image.
  - : Increased logo size and changed text.
  - : Added  to fix a mobile scroll bug.
  - : Updated the favicon link.
  - : Added the  dependency.
- **Created:**
  - Numerous image files in  and .
  - New logo and favicon assets in .

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The  component has grown significantly and contains large blocks of JSX and complex Tailwind CSS classes. It would be beneficial to break down the Hero, Über Uns, and the new Slider sections into separate, reusable components to improve maintainability and readability.

**key api endpoints**
- N/A

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **User Language is German.** All responses MUST be in German.
- The user is highly focused on visual details and provides iterative feedback. The recommended workflow is: implement a change, provide a screenshot, and ask for confirmation before proceeding.
- The initial idea of a persistent background image was rejected. The approved design places images contextually within specific sections of the homepage.
- Pay close attention to responsiveness. The user checks both desktop and mobile views and has specific requirements for each.
- The  class on the main container in  is critical to prevent horizontal scrolling on mobile. Be careful not to break this.
